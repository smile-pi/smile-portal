## SMILE Pi

The SMILE-pi (SMILE Plug) is a low-cost hardware solution that allows instructors to create a private micro-cloud for up to 20 users. 
SMILE-pi creates a portable Wi-Fi access point, gateway, and content server with which users can access SMILE Global from any device. 

The SMILE Pi can also serve static content from a plugged in USB Flash Drive.
The SMILE Pi serves the Stanford Mobile Inquiry-Based Learning Environment (SMILE) software, in addition to other available open education resources.
